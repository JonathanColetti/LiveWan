"""Blockcausal Wan forward shared by training and streaming inference.

One implementation serves both regimes, which is the point: what the student is
trained under is literally the code that runs at deployment.

    inference   BufferKV  -> preallocated StreamingKVCache, no_grad, batch 1
    training    TrainKV   -> plain per-layer tensors, autograd-safe, batched

The contract in both cases is the papers' "KV construction": the past is a
*clean* (t=0) key/value prefix laid down by an earlier pass, and the current
block is the only thing carrying noise. Block-causality is therefore structural
-- the key set only ever holds past + current -- so no attention mask is needed
over it, and adding one would wrongly serialise tokens within a block.

Two ways to run the noisy blocks of a clip, both against the same clean prefix:

  block_forward           one block, sequential. What inference does.
  parallel_blocks_forward every block of the clip as a batch row, one forward.
                          Each row carries its own noise level and its own
                          absolute RoPE offset, and reads the prefix slice its
                          start index implies. Used for training.

PER-FRAME TIMESTEP CONDITIONING (v0.2). Upstream Wan folds one shared `e0` into
every token, so a sequence mixing a clean past with a noisy present is
inexpressible in a single forward. `time_embed` here accepts a per-latent-frame
vector, giving modulation [F, 6, dim] applied to x viewed as [B, F, S, dim].
With the pre-computed clean K/V above it is not *required*. The clean prefix
is laid down by its own t=0 pass -- but it is what makes a block of mixed noise
levels expressible at all, and a uniform scalar collapses to upstream's
behaviour exactly, so the original weights load and run unchanged.
